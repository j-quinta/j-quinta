    <h1>Amusing</h1>
    <h3>by Joseph Quintana</h3>
    <p>Here is a few mildly amusing things on the internet that I found interesting</p>

    <h2>Basoonist playing "Cliffs of Dover"</h2>
    <p>This video is one of the coolest renditions of "Cliffs of Dover" specifically because the basoon isnt a common instrument for rock songs.</p>

    <h2>John Dudley's 500 yard shot</h2>
    <p>Archery has been a big part of my life over the last year and a half. This video is insane!</p>

    <h2>Archives</h2>
    <p>This page actually comes from this class, I thought it was very amusing that I could go back in time to see what websites looked like from 2007</p>
