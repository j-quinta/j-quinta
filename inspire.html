        		What makes a hero? A hero is someone that we look up to. Heroes embody what we truly value most. Therefore who we select as role models says a lot about who we are as people.

        		Michael Reynolds is the person to me that showed how we should be living. Radical sustainability in architecture is a passion of mine to say the least!

    		<ul>
        		<li>Outrageously courageous - He disturbed the status quo and defined a new and innovative way to live.</li>
        		<li>Motivates others - people follow a great leader</li>
        		<li>Big footprint - impact on millions and change the world</li>
        		<li>Integrity - they live true to their calling</li>
    		</ul>
    		<p>
        		Michael Reynolds inpired me to make sustainable living a goal. His architecture shows that our homes shouldnt be confined to a building code, and that they should be more than just a house.
